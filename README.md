This is my notes from TCMSecurity's Python 101 and 201 for Hackers

## Python 101

**What is Python?**
1. Dynamic, interpreted, object-oriented, high-level language
2. Versatile with a mature standard library
3. Actively used with a large community

**Why learn Python as a hacker?**
1. Understand how PoCs work
2. Debug, modify and run scripts or PoCs
3. Create your own scripts
4. Understanding how an app works could also lead to understanding how it could break
